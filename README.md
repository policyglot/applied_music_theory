# applied_music_theory
Applies Western music theory to Billboard 100 and Spotify music data to determine the ingredients of our species' most popular songs

This repository explores this theory through a number of routes around chord progressions, with many ideas based on Jake Lizzio's (superbly structured and presented) guitar lessons on his Youtube Channel. These include:
1) Standard Chord Progressions and Cadences
2) Mode Switches
3) Borrowing Chords from Other Scales
4) Use of 7th chords

Written entirely in Python, this repository serves as the foundation of potential future apps that could help aspiring musicians to understand both the rules and how to break them in creative ways as they discover their own style.
